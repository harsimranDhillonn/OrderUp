**The Purpose of OrderUp:**
Our app is designed to streamline the food ordering and delivery process for our customers. 


**How to Run Our App:**

Either create a new account by registering or sign in using our existing account:

    - The credentials are: email: admin2@email.com, password: admin123
    - The account already has a linked credit card and an address


We have existing credit card codes that that work for adding account balance:

    - "6748369873539860" is a code for 5.00$
    - "0086811568571859" is a code for 10.00$
    - "8081831768969802" is a code for 20.00$
    - "1785555962791673" is a code for 50.00$
    - "7923457638237639" is a code for 100.00$
