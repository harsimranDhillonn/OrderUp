**Discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration.**
**Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective).**

For us as a team we have determined that our time management was not as successful as we had liked. We realized that when you're managing a large project with 5 people that even with good communication it's hard to have a full picture of what needs to be done and our progress in individual areas. We can improve this by thoroughly outlining what each team member is going to be working on and setting deadlines for what needs to be finished spanning throughout the iteration before the final due date. That way it's harder to procrastinate and push everything to the end where the amount of remaining work becomes overwhelming. We can also take all the information from the iteration description and rubric and make sure we're hitting the points described while working on the project, instead of what we've done historically which was only thoroughly looking through the rubric and description on the last couple days. Our success as a team for working on our time management at the end of the iteration will be determined by how much of our initial goals, we were able to accomplish. We can measure that by looking at the ratio of features and user stories we were able to complete through the 3 iterations compared to the number of features and user stories that need to be pushed to the future milestone. Another factor to determine our success will be how well we were able to stick to the guidelines for our project. We can measure that by looking at the rubrics for our iterations and our grades and seeing what work we didn't complete by the marks we lost. Both of these measurements are applicable to time management since if we have poor time management these are the things that will be left out, as we experienced during iteration 1 when we missed our ARCHITECTURE.md file because we only thoroughly went through the rubric and description on the last day and during iteration 1 and 2 when we didn't finish as many user stories and features as we had planned due to not being specific enough in assigning work. A concrete way we can improve as a team separate from time management would be working on our smells and bugs before we start coding new features. Not doing so caused as a lot of headaches since it added to our merge conflicts which made merging our feature branches back into main more complicated than it had to be. We can determine the success of working on bugs and smells early by the amount of merge conflicts that we need to resolve pertaining to the fixing of those smells and bugs when we merge our feature branches. Another concreate way we can improve would be implementing dev tasks in our features and user stories. Doing so would allow us to visualize more easily what needs to be done to implement a feature or user story which would in turn allow us to complete more features and user stories by the end of the iteration. We can evaluate the success of adding dev tasks at the end of the iteration by how many of our issues for features and user stories have dev tasks and also how many features and user stories we were additionally able to complete compared to what we had done in iteration 1 and iteration 2.
