Also, as a team, complete a retrospective activity based on your work from the previous iteration:

**Discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration.**

For us as a team we have determined that our time management was not as successful as we had liked. We realized that when you're managing a large project with 5 people that even with good communication it's hard to have a full picture of what needs to be done and our progress in individual areas. We can improve this by throughly outlining what each team member is going to be working on and setting deadlines for what needs to be finished spanning throughout the iteration before the final due date. That way it's harder to procrastinate and push everything to the end where the amount of remaining work becomes overwhelming. We can also take all the information from the iteration description and rubric and make sure we're hitting the points described while working on the project, instead of what we've done historically which was only throughly looking through the rubirc and description on the last couple days. Our success as a team for this project at the end of the iteration will be determined by how much of our initial goals we were able to accomplish. We can measure that by looking at the ratio of features and user stories we were able to complete through the 3 iterations compared to the amount of features and user stories that need to be pushed to the future milestone. Another factor to determine our success will be how well we were able to stick to the guidelines for our project. We can measure that by looking at the rubrics for our iterations and our grades and seeing what work we didn't complete by the marks we lost. 


**Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective).**



**Also include a chart (as an image) showing the 2 data points of project velocity from the last two iterations.**
